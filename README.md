This is an SDL engine that will be run for various programs.

Version Numre standard is still not regulated and some commits may be inaccurate but here is the proposed method.

0.0.0a

Release Number -> Beta Number -> Goal Number + Release Suffix

### Release Number
This will only be Updated for a final working version. At this point the project functions in every intended way.

### Beta Number
This is updated every time the Project reaches a new level of functionality. When ever this updates the end user will actually be able to functionally use the program.

### Goal Number
Goal Numbers are for sub parts of Betas. This may be noticeable by an end user but not a major change or is only accesable by the dev.

### Release Suffix
Updated when a minor change or bugfix has been made.
